# Description:
In sf-car-predictions notebook I tried to implement Xception base model + fine tuning on kaggle, however, as I made mistakes I exceeded GPU limit. Submission results were around 92%.  
So I decided to run new notebook on Google Collab, tried different augmentation techniques and used EfficientNetB2 as base model. Submission results: 0.95895.
